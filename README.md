Message: AADSTS50020: User account 'tanasakm1@hotmail.com' from identity provider 'live.com' does not exist in tenant 'Microsoft Services' and cannot access the application 'f44b1140-bc5e-48c6-8dc0-5cf5a53c0e34'(Microsoft Edge) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account.
